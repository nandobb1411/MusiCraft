# MusiCraft (AI-Powered Musical Composition System)

This repository presents the conception and implementation of an innovative musical composition system based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). This system combines genetic algorithms and generative models to create music autonomously. The project spans from initial research on AI applications in music production to the practical implementation of the system in popular music production software. 

## Overview

The methodology used in this project involves the development of a genetic algorithm to generate melodies, which are then used as input for a generative model to create rhythmic accompaniments. Various machine learning techniques, including recurrent neural networks and transformers, will be explored to generate beats from the melodies. The final outcome will be the integration of the genetic algorithm and the generative model into music production software.

## Features

- Genetic algorithm for melody generation
- Generative models for rhythmic accompaniments
- Utilization of recurrent neural networks and transformers
- Integration with popular music production software
